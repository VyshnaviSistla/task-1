	<h2 id="career"> <u> Career </u> </h2>
	<center> <p> Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar (born 22 June 1974[2][3]), known professionally as Vijay, is an Indian actor and singer who works predominantly in Tamil cinema.[4][5] He is among the highest paid actors in India[6][7] and has featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list on seven occasions.[8][9] He has played the lead in 66 films and the International Business Times framed him as a "consistent performer".[10] Referred to as Thalapathy (transl. Commander), Vijay has a significant following internationally.[11][6] He has won several awards, including an Osaka Best Actor Award and a South Indian International Movie Award.[12][13] In 2023, he became the highest paid actor in India and one of the top paid actors in the world.[14]
    Vijay was born as Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar on 22 June 1974 in Madras (now Chennai), Tamil Nadu.[15] His father S. A. Chandrasekhar is a Tamil film director[16] and his mother Shoba Chandrasekhar is a playback singer and carnatic vocalist.[17] His father is of Christian Vellalar descent and his mother is Hindu.[18][19] Vijay was baptised at the age of 12.[18] Vijay had a sister, Vidhya, who died when she was just two years old.[20]

In the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity. He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.

Subramaniam against Vijay.[165][166] On 15 July 2022, the court declared that no fine should be imposed on the car imported by since he had paid the full entry tax before January 2019, closing out the case in the process.[167][168][169]
